# Rock Paper Scissors Game 

Simple rock, paper, scissors game made using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript that I developed during my full-stack developer course.
This was done last year but submitting to Github now to clear up some space in my laptop.

## Usage

User can play against the computer by clicking on one of the emoji (Rock, Paper or Scissors).
